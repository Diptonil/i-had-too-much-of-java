# I Had Too Much of Java
(this is for laters...!)


## Running the programs:

I used Visual Studio Code with the extension `Language Support for Java (TM) by Red Hat`. I would not know the procedure for executing the files in environments like IntelliJ or Eclipse. I shall add sections for them as soon as I start working in those environments (if I do).
I have the required dependencies installed.
To run the programs:
- From the directory in which the source file is stored:
  `javac fileName.java`
- From the root directory:
  `java packageName.fileName`
