# Inheritance

- This section covers inheritance in detail. It is the policy by which resuablility and abstraction in implemented in Java. We can extend and reuse functionality without reinventing the wheel. This also makes for more effective program partitioning and segregation.
- The scope of inheritance is largely influenced by access specifiers.
- Multiple inheritance is not supported. Heirarchial inheritance is.


## Private Superclass Access Specifier




## Uses

- Runtime polymorphism by method overriding.
- Code reusability.


## Programs

- `SimpleInheritance.java`: This shows basic inheritance and how the subclasss has access to *every* public or default methods and members of the superclass.
